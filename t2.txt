Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change
You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure, ain't that serious
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh, company.
