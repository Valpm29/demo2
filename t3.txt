You got a new life
Am I bothering you?
Do you wanna talk?
We share the last tine 
Then we drink the wall
I go 'round and 'round
Satellite
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I'm right here?
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I'm right here?
Spinning out, waiting for ya
