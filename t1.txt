Tell me that you're still mine 
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart 
I need to say 
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burns us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the Afterglow.
